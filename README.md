### Why I Made This Project?
- So it started with something like:
- I stopped using instagram for socializing. All because  scrolling was wasting hours of my day.
- But Getting the updates of social media which were exclusive on Instagram became a little harder.
- When others sends me it's ok but when I need to share them something without downloading was hell.
- if I make a new id friends would find it because of the share card feature of Instagram.
- Whenever I shared any post, my id used to be visible to them.
- Then they dm me the posts like spam.
- If I watch a reel I could easily fall into the loop again and again.
- All this was a waste time and I used to irritate each time.
- I found a way to share the posts but this time without showing up my id. But it was a bit of a long process.
- So I wrote an automated script for this and created a site for my convenience. 
- Well the site is published so everyone can use it

### Feedback 
- Well, you might have observed locked features on the site.
- Those are not broken, just I haven't made the features available.
- Although in this application I have decided to add more features to it but unable to sit and code the things as I have to focus on some other necessary stuff too.
- if you are facing any bugs or have some suggestions, please do let me know.
- for now you can pull a request or contact me, whatever you wish.
